# Lid-Driven-Cavity

This repository serves as a comprehensive documentation of my journey to realise my first CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics). Throughout this repository, I will meticulously detail the step-by-step process that led me to grasp the fundamentals of CFD. Commencing with a focus on mathematical foundations, I will delve into computations and problem-solving techniques. The ultimate aim is to progress steadily towards the application of CFD, culminating in the simulation of a Lid Driven Cavity.
